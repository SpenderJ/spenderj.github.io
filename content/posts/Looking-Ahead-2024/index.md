# Happy new year 2024

### Why this topic ?

Hello folks! To those of you who know me on a more personal level, you'll probably know that I am not the
kind of guy to have "new year resolutions", I am way too impulsive for this, and I almost take some of these daily.

That's how I ended up running a Marathon with 3 months of training with no past experience running, that's why I decided to 
join 42...

But this year, I thought that I could use this opportunity to set myself goals, that I could reflect on by the end of the year !

*So with no further ado let's get into it !*


### Where would I want to be next year on the 1st of January ?

*As I'm writting this I figure how big of a commitment it is...*

**Professional life**:
- IC3 which would mean that I became a Senior Engineer
- Working with a dynamic company, that embodies my values and desire to grow (BackMarket is a great example of this).
- Align my professional life and personal life (an ocean apart is no fun)..

**Personal life**:
- Start practicing trail
- Take part in either 1 marathon or 60km+ in trail
- Keep going to the office as much as I can

### How was 2023 ?

As you might know already, 2023 has been a great year for me. I am thriving at BackMarket, where I am filled
with mission, great coworkers and I really enjoy my work.

On a personal level, I am happy, which is something great and definetely something to keep on going for 2024.
I am looking forward to 2024, and would like to thank everyone that I met and worked with to have made my year so great.

**Let's be happy and keep on making refurbished devices cool !**
