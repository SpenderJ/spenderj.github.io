# Back Market Adventures: Two Years of Refurbished Tech and Thriving Challenges

### How did I get there:

After two years at Engie, where I played a part in the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy and helped reduce
energy consumption through data-driven insights, I felt the itch for a change. While data was certainly fascinating,
the initial spark that ignited my passion for computers was the allure of software creation. With a desire to continue
making a positive impact on the world and contribute to tackling the pressing environmental challenges we face, I sought
a company that genuinely championed sustainability.

BackMarket emerged as a beacon of hope, a company that seamlessly integrated technology with social responsibility. As
an existing customer since 2019, I was deeply impressed by BackMarket's mission to democratize access to refurbished
electronics, extending the lifespan of devices and minimizing the environmental footprint associated with electronics
consumption.

After a series of insightful interviews, I was thrilled to join the BackMarket team, eager to embark on a new adventure
filled with exciting challenges, opportunities for growth, and the chance to make a lasting impact on the planet. Little
did I know the magnitude of personal and professional growth that awaited me, the inevitable setbacks that would fuel my
resilience, and the invaluable lessons I would learn along the way.

### From Data-Scientist to Backend Engineer

My switch from Data Scientist to Backend Engineer was an eye-opening experience that showed me how much more there is to
Python than I thought. As a Data Scientist, I used Python for data analysis and model building.
But backend engineering is a whole different world, and it took me a while to get used to it.

Django and Fast API, the frameworks used for BackMarket's backend, and the huge volume of code seemed insurmountable.
It seemed at the beginning a lot more complex than the Data Science that I was used to. Thanks to the help of my
supportive colleagues, I gradually got the hang of it and quickly managed to deliver value to Back Market.

Through this journey, I learned that mastering Python is a never-ending process. There's always more to learn, and
that's what keeps it exciting (and also one of the reasons of the start of this blog). I am eager to continue exploring
Python's limitless possibilities, and who knows I might as well have fun with a few other languages (Rust...).

### My technical landscape at Back Market

As a Backend Engineer within the Supply Journey tribe's Shipping and Logistic squad, I'm an integral part of a dynamic
and agile team. Our Trifecta, composed of a Product Manager, an Engineering Manager, and an Operational expert, ensures
seamless collaboration and decision-making. Comprising six engineers with diverse backgrounds and a high level of
seniority, our squad fosters a culture of knowledge sharing and mentorship.

We play a key role in maintaining the legacy monolith while spearheading the migration of critical features to our newly
developed Fast API microservice. Our team has successfully transitioned the majority of functionalities to the
microservice, but we still maintain the monolith for specific features.

We hold the reins of BackMarket's entire delivery process, overseeing everything from customer-facing delivery dates and
address forms to Backship integration, label generation, and carrier optimization. My responsibilities encompass
designing features, creating tickets, refining specifications, and, of course, diving into the coding process.

Here are some examples of my recent accomplishments:

- Conducted load testing in preparation for Black Friday
- Collaborated with multiple teams to extract models from the monolith
- Designed and implemented APIs and caching mechanisms
- Led the design and implementation of new features

I thrive in this fast-paced and ever-evolving environment, constantly learning and adapting to new challenges.
BackMarket's commitment to innovation and sustainability fuels my passion for technology and my desire to make a
positive impact on the world.

### Culture and Camaraderie

Back Market's success is not merely a product of innovative technology or strategic business decisions; it's the
unwavering spirit and dedication of its people that truly drive the company forward. Despite facing challenges in 2022,
BackMarket emerged stronger, its resilience fueled by the collective resolve of its employees.

As a member of this exceptional team, I've witnessed firsthand the transformative power of collaboration and camaraderie.
The monthly events and yearly all-hands gatherings are not just social occasions; they are vibrant expressions of the
company's unity and shared purpose that I wouldn't miss !

Sport has always been an integral part of my life, instilling in me the value of teamwork and the power of collective
effort. At BackMarket, I've found a workplace that mirrors the principles of teamwork and camaraderie I cherish from the
world of sports. The shared goals, the mutual support, and the collective celebration of achievements create an
environment where individuals thrive and the company flourishes.

To every Back Maker I've had the privilege of working with, thank you for making these past two years an unforgettable
journey. Your dedication, passion, and unwavering commitment have not only contributed to the company's success but have
also enriched my personal and professional growth. I am incredibly grateful to be part of such an exceptional team, and
I look forward to many more years of collaboration, innovation, and shared success.

### Conclusion:

I'm immensely thankful for the opportunity to be a part of BackMarket, a company that embodies innovation,
sustainability, and the power of teamwork. The past two years have been an incredible journey of learning, growth, and
shared achievements with my fellow Back Makers.

Looking forward, I'm committed to continuous learning, personal and professional evolution, and contributing to
BackMarket's success. Together, we will continue to revolutionize the refurbished tech industry and make a positive
impact on the world.

Thank you, BackMarket, for the transformative experience.
