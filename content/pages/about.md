### Tech Enthusiast, Data Wrangler, and Self-Proclaimed Coding Ninja

I'm Jules, a tech enthusiast with a knack for wrangling data and a passion for coding.

I am currently a BackEnd Engineer at Back Market, where I help making refurbished devices cool again and have a positive
impact for the planet ([Definitive proof that choosing refurbished helps the planet](https://www.backmarket.com/en-us/c/news/impact-of-refurbished-on-environment)).

Before that, I was a Data Scientist at Engie, where I used my skills to help improve customer satisfaction, lower the consumption
of energy from our clients and AGAIN make the world greener but this time through helping companies achieve their decarbonization.

### From Data Scientist to BackEnd Engineer: A Journey Filled with Data, Code, and a Touch of Madness

My journey into the tech world began with a simple question: "What can I do with numbers and computers to make the world a better place?"
That question led me to 42 then Engie, where I discovered the power of data to drive real change. As a Data Scientist, I used my
skills in machine learning and natural language processing to develop models that improved customer satisfaction, increased sales,
and even accelerate the transition towards a carbon-neutral economy.

After a few years at Engie, I decided to take my tech skills to the next level and joined Back Market, a company that's
revolutionizing the way we buy and sell electronics. As a BackEnd Engineer, I'm responsible for designing and implementing
algorithms that improve the relevance of customer data, deploying services to new regions, and
migrating historical monoliths into microservices. It's a challenging but rewarding job, and I love being part of a team
that's making a real impact on the world.

Most specifically, I am part of the Shipping and Logistic squad, our goal is to provide our customers the most accurate data regarding
their delivery, optimize the whole delivery process and work with transporters to lower the delivery carbon footprint.

### When I'm Not Coding or Wrangling Data

When I'm not busy coding or wrangling data, you can find me on the tennis court, football pitch, or training for my next marathon.
I'm also a big fan of traveling and exploring new cultures.

### So, what can I expect from this blog?

In this blog, I'll share my insights and experiences as a tech enthusiast, data wrangler, and self-proclaimed coding ninja.
Expect a mix of technical tutorials, personal anecdotes, and a healthy dose of humor. I hope you'll join me on this journey
into the ever-evolving world of technology.

Cheers,

Jules Spender
