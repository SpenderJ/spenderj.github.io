### Tech Enthusiast, Data Wrangler, and Self-Proclaimed Coding Ninja

I'm Jules, a tech enthusiast with a knack for wrangling data and a passion for coding. I'm currently a BackEnd Engineer at Back Market, where I help make refurbished devices cool again. Before that, I was a Data Scientist at Engie, where I used my data-wrangling skills to help improve customer satisfaction and boost sales.

### From Data Scientist to BackEnd Engineer: A Journey Filled with Data, Code, and a Touch of Madness

My journey into the tech world began with a simple question: "What can I do with numbers and computers to make the world a better place?" That question led me to Engie, where I discovered the power of data to drive real change. As a Data Scientist, I used my skills in machine learning and natural language processing to develop models that improved customer satisfaction, increased sales, and even earned and accelerate the transition towards a carbon-neutral economy.

After a few years at Engie, I decided to take my tech skills to the next level and joined Back Market, a company that's revolutionizing the way we buy and sell electronics. As a BackEnd Engineer, I'm responsible for designing and implementing algorithms that improve the relevance of customer data, deploying services to new regions, and migrating historical monoliths into microservices. It's a challenging but rewarding job, and I love being part of a team that's making a real impact on the world.

### When I'm Not Coding or Wrangling Data

When I'm not busy coding or wrangling data, you can find me on the tennis court, football pitch, or training for my next marathon. I'm also a big fan of traveling and exploring new cultures.

### So, what can I expect from this blog?

In this blog, I'll share my insights and experiences as a tech enthusiast, data wrangler, and self-proclaimed coding ninja. Expect a mix of technical tutorials, personal anecdotes, and a healthy dose of humor. I hope you'll join me on this journey into the ever-evolving world of technology.

Cheers,

Jules Spender
